      <description>While on a nice week long vacation with my family I had the opportunity to think a little more than I often can. My normal fleeting thoughts of our human condition bounced around as I considered automation and the rate of technological change due to exponential knowledge gain. Heathcare systems and guaranteed income are often part of this jumble of thoughts. I seemed to meander into the human aspect this time.</description>

      <description>It was time for a site refresh&amp;hellip;  jeffkulas.com was way out of date .. my last post was from 2012! my site did not support TLS octopress was kind of weird to me since I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with ruby  I decided to switch over to github pages and looked for a static site generator to replace octopress and I found Hugo.
First Impression  hugo is fast live reload is really nice and just works adding and customizing themes is easy playing around with a theme is nice as it helps me understand some of hugo&amp;rsquo;s concepts  So far so good.</description>
